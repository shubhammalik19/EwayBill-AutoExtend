# EwayBill-AutoExtend
Eway Bill AutoExtend is a Python script that automates the extension of eway bills using Selenium. It reads eway bill data from a CSV, logs into the portal, extends bills about to expire, and logs the process. The script is time-bound and includes vehicle data extraction for accurate extension.
